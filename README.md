This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

Logistical:
What hours will you be available to communicate?  Push until done (call it at 7 at latest)
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Remo and Slack
How often will you take breaks? 10 minutes per hour
What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Reach out, adhere to 15 minute rule
Cooperative:
Make a list of each person’s strengths. Sam: Elasticity Vinny: Adaptability
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? With the open communication that we will keep, we will be able to hop on each other’s sides of the project and help out if need be.
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? Sam: Understanding of front and back end and how they connect. Vinny: Better understanding of modularity within the application as a whole
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? Three meetings a day for near constant understanding of where each other is at in the coding process so that we may effectively monitor that process.
Conflict Resolution:
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? With the communication we will be able to monitor and keep a good eye on each other’s progress. If it becomes unbalanced we can talk it out or bring in Sheyna.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? Discuss at the meetings
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? With the communication we have an opportunity to teach each other if one is falling behind
