## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
An application meant for storage of book titles that have impacted us and ones that we would recommend to read.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Go to our URL and have fun reading.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
JavaScript
CSS
HTML
React
Axios
Cors
Express
Mongo
Mongoose
Bootstrap

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates

Logistical:
What hours will you be available to communicate?  Push until done (call it at 7 at latest)
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Remo and Slack
How often will you take breaks? 10 minutes per hour
What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Reach out, adhere to 15 minute rule
Cooperative:
Make a list of each person’s strengths. Sam: Elasticity Vinny: Adaptability
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? With the open communication that we will keep, we will be able to hop on each other’s sides of the project and help out if need be.
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? Sam: Understanding of front and back end and how they connect. Vinny: Better understanding of modularity within the application as a whole
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? Three meetings a day for near constant understanding of where each other is at in the coding process so that we may effectively monitor that process.
Conflict Resolution:
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? With the communication we will be able to monitor and keep a good eye on each other’s progress. If it becomes unbalanced we can talk it out or bring in Sheyna.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? Discuss at the meetings
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? With the communication we have an opportunity to teach each other if one is falling behind
